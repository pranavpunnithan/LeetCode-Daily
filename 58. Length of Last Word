Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.

A word is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "Hello World"
Output: 5
Explanation: The last word is "World" with length 5.
Example 2:

Input: s = "   fly me   to   the moon  "
Output: 4
Explanation: The last word is "moon" with length 4.
Example 3:

Input: s = "luffy is still joyboy"
Output: 6
Explanation: The last word is "joyboy" with length 6.



/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {number}
 */
var lengthOfLastWord = function(s) {
    let trimmed=s.trim();
    let words=trimmed.split(" ");
    let lastword=words[words.length-1]
    return lastword.length

};




You get a string s.

First, s.trim() cleans the junk spaces at the start and end.

Then, .split(" ") breaks it into words wherever there's a space.

words[words.length - 1] grabs the last word.

.length gives you the size of that last word.

Finally, return spits that number out.

Example:

Input: " Hello World "

Trimmed: "Hello World"

Split: ["Hello", "World"]

Last word: "World"

Length: 5
